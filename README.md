# Temperature-Analytics

I attempt to predict the temperature based on other weather conditions such as humidty and weather. In order to achieve robustness, a number of statistical test were performed to test the model as well as the underlying assumptions of normality, homoscedasticity, indepedence, autocorrelation and stationarity.
